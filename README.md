# myCircularBuffer-using-memcpy-C
My implementation of circular (ring) data buffer in C, using memcpy() to increase the speed of en-queue &amp; de-queue function for a large data array.
My purpose is to use this implementation on a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) works in an embedded system as the "signal buffer".
